In this assignment we calculated the pagerank of the wikipedia pages, with the help of hadoop MapReduce basics. This was done using 3 MapReduce phases out of which the second MapReduce was run 10 times using a for-loop.

Commands used to run

$ javac -cp /usr/lib/hadoop/*:/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/* PageRank.java -d build -Xlint
$ jar -cvf pagerank.jar -C build/ .
$ hadoop fs -rm -r output*
$ hadoop jar pagerank.jar org.myorg.PageRank input output1 output2 output3 output4 output5 output6 output7 output8 output9 output10 output11 output12

The separators used in each of these were as follows
<title.*?>(.*?)</title>
To separate the contents from the title tags.

<text.*?>(.*?)</text>
To separate the contents from the text tags.

\\[\\[(.*?)\\]\\]
To separate the contents from the [[]].
